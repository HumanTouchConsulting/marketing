              <p>Through the use of a video camera, there is no risk of receiving biased information from a single individual. Rather, you receive 
                a clear, accurate and thorough picture of the customer experience unique to your business, which you receive almost immediately.<br />
                <br />
                Upon completion, the video shops are sent directly to the Human Touch Consulting offices. Customer service consultants view, and rate the business and employee performance, according to the client\xe2\x80\x99s Customer Service Standard. This information is then compiled into a RYGTM   Performance Report.<br />
                <br />
                Within 24-48 hours, you receive an email notifying you that your video shops have been posted on a secure web server, where you and your team may access them, using your assigned username &amp; password.<br />
                <br />
                Along with your video shops, you also receive your RYG\xe2\x84\xa2 Performance Report generated by our Customer Service Consultant<br />
                s. The report is based on the assessment of employee performance by our Customer Service Consultants in several key areas, and contains the compiled scores for all of your video shops: over-all, by area, and by each individual location.<br />
                <br />
                Then within 3-5 days you receive a fully edited, menu driven DVD with all your video shops arranged on the DVD according to your company structure by area, district, market, region, etc. You will receive 2 copies of each DVD, one for your main office and the other for the field.<br />
                <br />
                In addition to the Video Shop, the RYG Performance Report may be used for training and incentive purposes.</p>
